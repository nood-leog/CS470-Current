Linux command explanation in your report:
Explain the following Linux command (cp, ps, ls, mv, rm, mkdir,

For above commands, you are required to: A. Provide a description of
each function. B. Illustrate its usage with a practical example.


cp
The cp command stands for "Copy", and is used to copy files or directories from one location to another. Example:
/somedir$ cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt

ps 
The ps command stands for "Process Status", and is used to display information about running processes. Example:
/somedir$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 1234 pts/0    00:00:01 bash
 5678 pts/0    00:00:02 python script.py

ls
The ls command stands for "List", and is used to list the contents of a directory. Example:
/somedir$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

mv
The mv command stands for "Move", and is used to move or rename files and directories. Example:
/somedir$ mv old_file.txt new_file.txt

rm
The rm command stands for "Remove", and is used to delete files or directories. Example:
/somedir$ rm my_file.txt
/somedir$ rm -r my_directory

mkdir
The mkdir command stands for "Make Directory", and is used to create and name a directory/folder. Example:

rmdir 
The rmdir command stands for "Remove Directory", and is used to delete an empty directory. Example:

output: removes the directory named my_directory if it is empty.

echo 
The echo command outputs, or echos, the strings it is given. Example:
/somedir$ echo "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!

Aternatively by using a " > ", we redirect the echoed output into a file
/somedir$ echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
output: creates a file named hello.txt with the content "Hello, World!"

more
The more command is used to view the contents of a file one screen at a time. It allows you to scroll through the file. Example:
/somedir$ more my_file.txt
output: Displays the contents of my_file.txt one screen at a time. You can press the spacebar to go to the next page or 'q' to quit.

date
The date command displays or sets the system date and time. Example:
/somedir$ date  
Weekday Month Day hh:mm:ss timezone year

time
The time command is used to measure the duration of execution of a command. It provides information about the time taken by a command to execute. Example:
/somedir$ time ls
real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.001s

kill 
The kill command is used to terminate processes by sending them a signal. It can be used to stop a process that is running in the background or foreground. Example:
/somedir$ kill 1234 

history
The history command displays the list of commands that have been executed in the current shell session. Example:
/somedir$ history
  1  ls
  2  cd somedir
  3  cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt
  4  ps

chmod
The chmod command stands for "Change Mode", and is used to change the file system modes of files and directories, specifically their permissions. Example:
/somedir$ chmod -x my_script.sh
chmod is most commonly used with these flags, where:
-x means remove execute permission
+x means add execute permission
+w means add write permission
-w means remove write permission
-r means remove read permission
+r means add read permission

chown
The chown command stands for "Change Owner", and is used to change the ownership of files and directories. Example:
/somedir$ chown user:group my_file.txt
This command changes the owner of my_file.txt to user and the group to group. It is often used by system administrators to manage file permissions and ownership.
